# Serverless Rock Paper Scissors

A one-click-deploy serverless implementation of Rock Paper Scissors. 

## AWS Credentials

Running this code requires you to have an AWS account and to have your AWS credentials configured on the machine you are using to run this code. If you already have AWS credentials set up you can skip this section.

If you do not have an account you can sign up for one here: https://aws.amazon.com/. It is recommended that you do not use you root credentials but rather [create a separate IAM user role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users) for yourself (This is similar to root vs user on a personal computer). 

Once you have your credentials (access key id and secret access key) you will need to store them locally in the standard files:
* `~/.aws/credentials` on macOS or Linux
* `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows.
